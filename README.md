# Space Invaders Game

This project is my implementation of the classic Space Invaders arcade game using Java.


# Introduction:
    Space Invaders is a classic arcade game where players control a spaceship and shoot at waves of descending alien invaders.
    The objective is to eliminate all the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen and defeat the player.

# How to Play:
    
    1) Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

    2) Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.

    3) Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.

    4) Compile the Java source files using the following command:
           javac src/*.java
    5) Run the game by executing the main class:
          java -classpath src SpaceInvaders
    6) Use the arrow keys or the "W, A, S, D" to control the spaceship, and spacebar to shoot lasers.

    7) Aim to destroy all the alien invaders while avoiding their projectiles.

    8) The game ends when the player loses all three health bars.
